# Guardian AI Metaculus CLI
Guardian AI's Metaculus CLI leverages various APIs to predict outcomes for questions on Metaculus. It uses [AskNews](https://asknews.app/) for gathering relevant news articles and OpenAI for generating predictions. This project is open-sourced and maintained by [Guardian AI](https://guardianai.io).

This project is a rewrite in javascript of the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tc383HraMZOiyfKFF1EXAtlTYbsuv3Q5?usp=sharing) in python provided by Asknews.

You will find the original prompt, and some variations.

In order to improve predictions for certain topics we will add integration with data sources from Guardian AI.
