    forecast: "Based on the available information and recent developments, it appears likely that SpaceX will attempt to catch a Starship booster with the tower before September 30, 2024. The company has been making steady progress with Starship development, and recent statements from Elon Musk indicate a strong intention to attempt this maneuver in the near future. The release of teaser footage on July 5th further supports this likelihood. However, this attempt is subject to technical readiness, regulatory approval, and favorable weather conditions.",
    resolutionCriteria: "This question resolves as Yes if SpaceX attempts to catch the first stage booster of a Starship rocket using the launch tower (also known as 'Mechazilla' or 'chopsticks') at any point before 11:59 PM ET on September 30, 2024. The attempt does not need to be successful for a Yes resolution.",
    date: "2024-07-16T19:50:29.402Z",
    reasoning: "SpaceX has a history of rapidly iterating and attempting new technologies. The recent successful orbital flight and Musk's stated goals suggest they are moving quickly towards attempting a booster catch. The release of teaser footage is a strong indicator that they are close to attempting this maneuver. However, the complexity of the operation and the need for regulatory approval could potentially delay the attempt. The timeline between now and September 30th provides a reasonable window for SpaceX to prepare and execute this attempt, assuming no major setbacks.",

            summary: "SpaceX has conducted a test of the Super Heavy booster's engines, a precursor to the next Starship test, expected in the coming weeks. This will be the 5th launch of the fully assembled Starship and the most ambitious one yet. The booster, 71 meters tall, was transported to the launch site at SpaceX's test facility in Texas on July 9, ahead of the 'full-duration static fire test' held yesterday at the Starbase structure. With Super Heavy fixed to the launch platform, the 33 Raptor engines of the rocket worked at full thrust for about 20 seconds. Each Starship test flight has surpassed the previous one in terms of distance and results achieved, with the most recent launch in June celebrated as a complete success. Now, SpaceX hopes to surpass that success with the 5th Starship flight. Starship is designed as a fully reusable system. Unlike the current workhorse of SpaceX's fleet, when Super Heavy returns to land, it should return to the launch platform from which it was launched. The Starship tower is equipped with 2 enormous 'chopstick' arms designed to catch Super Heavy's grid fins, while the booster arrests its descent to momentarily hover in the air before yielding to the delicate grasp of the chopsticks. This way, the booster is already where it needs to be to be launched again. During the 4th flight, although Super Heavy's return to the ocean was far from the launch platform at Starbase, Texas, SpaceX closed the chopstick arms of the launch tower in sync with the booster's splashdown, apparently to test the timing and capabilities of the system. Now, they're going to put it to the test for real: the next launch could happen as early as August.",

            summary: "SpaceX has shared spectacular images of a static fire test of the Super Heavy booster before its fifth test flight as part of the Starship vehicle. The test showed the Raptor engines of the booster being lit while the vehicle is firmly fixed to the ground. SpaceX has also published several photos of the same test. The Starship, which stands 120 meters tall, including the first stage Super Heavy and the upper stage of the Starship spacecraft, is the most powerful rocket in the world and will one day carry its crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and possibly even farther into deep space. The rocket is expected to fly again next month, with the recent engine test being part of the preparations for this mission. The Starship has had four previous test flights, with the first two ending in anomalies, but the third and fourth tests showed significant improvements in the flight system, with the missions achieving most of their objectives. The fifth test, which could take place in August, will test a new landing procedure in which the Super Heavy booster is 'caught' by massive mechanical arms on the launch tower. This will allow SpaceX to reuse all the Super Heavy boosters it produces, significantly reducing launch costs.",

            summary: "Starship, a rocket developed by SpaceX, has the potential to revolutionize the space industry by making launches easier and more accessible. The rocket is set to carry the first private space station, Starlab, to orbit in 2028, and satellite operators have already signed up to use the launch vehicle. Starship's large payload capacity and low cost will also enable scientists to conduct more complex and ambitious research in space. NASA has invested in Starship and plans to use it to establish a lunar base and eventually send humans to Mars. So far, Starship has undergone four test flights, with the most recent one successfully returning to Earth.",

            summary: "The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has temporarily halted SpaceX's rocket launches after a Falcon 9 rocket experienced engine problems during a recent launch. The FAA has ordered an investigation into the incident, which occurred on July 11. The failure has raised concerns about the safety of future missions, including those for NASA and private space tourists. According to Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, the rocket's second stage engine failed to ignite, causing the rocket to break apart. The mission was intended to launch 20 Starlink internet satellites into orbit, but they did not reach the necessary altitude. This is the first time a Falcon 9 rocket has failed since 2015. SpaceX is working to recover the mission and has already established contact with five of the 20 satellites. The company is updating the satellites' software to prevent them from re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. 'It's not going to work like a Star Trek episode, but it's worth a try,' Musk said. The incident marks the end of a successful streak of 344 consecutive launches for SpaceX, which has secured its position as a leader in the industry.",

            summary: "SpaceX has shared photos of the Super Heavy booster being transported to the launch pad at its Boca Chica, Texas facility, ahead of the fifth test flight of the Starship spacecraft, scheduled for the first half of August. The Starship, with a height of 120 meters and a thrust of 17 million pounds at launch, is the largest and most powerful rocket ever launched. Once fully tested and certified for operational flights, it will likely be used to transport crew and cargo to the Moon and potentially even to Mars. The Starship has undergone several test flights, with the most recent one successfully reaching orbit. The upcoming test will attempt to use the launch tower's mechanical arms to 'catch' the first-stage booster as it lands, allowing SpaceX to reuse the booster for multiple missions and reduce costs.",

            summary: "SpaceX is preparing for the fifth test flight of its Starship spacecraft and is planning a new innovation. The launch tower, called 'Mechazilla', will catch the Super Heavy rocket, the giant booster of the Starship, in mid-air. The Super Heavy is the booster rocket of the Starship, standing 71 meters tall. Combined with the upper stage of the spacecraft, the rocket reaches 121 meters. The last test flight of the Starship took place on June 6 and was successful, but both the booster and the spacecraft landed in the water. From now on, SpaceX's goal is to prioritize the recovery of the stages for reuse in future tests. According to Elon Musk, CEO of the company, the launch of the fifth test flight of the Starship may take place this month if SpaceX receives authorization from the US. Meanwhile, on June 27, SpaceX published a video on X (formerly Twitter) showing how it will catch the giant rocket in mid-air without touching the ground. The tower, 'Mechazilla', has iron structures that are like hashis to catch the Super Heavy booster when it separates from the upper stage of the Starship and returns to Earth.",

            summary: "SpaceX has shared footage of its tower catch tests for the upcoming Starship test flight. The company is testing its 'chopsticks' arms to clamp down on a portion of the Super Heavy booster. The goal is to reduce the time taken to prepare the rocket for re-flight and eliminate the complexity of landing the world's largest first-stage rocket booster on legs. SpaceX's Starbase general manager, Kathy Leuders, has expressed doubts about the feasibility of the tower catch, but CEO Elon Musk is confident in the technology. The company is also building a second launch pad at the site and plans to establish a permanent fuel depot in Earth orbit for its Starship missions to the Moon and Mars.",

            summary: "SpaceX plans to attempt a new Starship launch as early as July, with a focus on catching the spacecraft during its return to Earth using mechanical arms on the launch tower. The company's fourth Starship launch on June 6 was a near-perfect success, with the spacecraft's first stage landing in the Gulf of Mexico and the second stage landing in the Indian Ocean. However, the landing was not without damage, with one of the fins beginning to melt due to the intense heat generated by re-entry into the atmosphere. Elon Musk has announced plans to test the Starship's heat shield, which has not yet been fully proven, and is also planning to replace the current heat shield tiles with new ones that are twice as resistant. The company aims to demonstrate its ability to catch the Starship during its return to Earth, a key part of its vision for reusable launches. ",

            summary: "SpaceX is planning to attempt a world-first maneuver by 'catching' the Starship rocket using robotic arms built into the launch tower after its next launch. The 120-meter-tall rocket will be delivered to orbit and then recovered by the Mechazilla tower, which is designed to support launch, vehicle integration, and booster catch. This will reduce mass from the launch vehicle, move hardware complexity to the ground, and enable rapid reuse of the rocket. The previous Starship flight test saw a successful splash-landing of the Super Heavy booster, a major step towards achieving reusability. SpaceX aims to build a massive fleet of Starship rockets to transport crew and cargo throughout the Solar System and establish a human colony on Mars within the next 10-20 years.",

            summary: "SpaceX is planning to conduct its fifth Starship test flight in late July, according to CEO Elon Musk. The previous test, IFT-4, was successful, with the rocket making a soft splashdown in the ocean. The next test will attempt to catch the Starship Super Heavy booster with the launch tower, a key step in making the rocket rapidly reusable. SpaceX has been working to overcome regulatory hurdles and is planning to test all systems close to the tower before attempting the catch. The company is also replacing the heat shield tiles on the second stage ship ahead of the next test.",

            summary: "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking public input on SpaceX's proposal to launch Starship from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The FAA will host public scoping meetings on June 12 and 13, and a virtual meeting on June 17. The meetings will inform the public and answer questions about SpaceX's proposal to launch Starship from LC-39A. The FAA will lead a review of impacts from SpaceX Starship operations across various areas, including air quality, coastal resources, land use, noise, and water resources. The assessment is a follow-up to an environmental review conducted in 2019. SpaceX's proposal includes the construction of additional launch infrastructure, including a Super Heavy booster catch tower, a natural gas liquefaction system, and air separation unit for propellant generation, and stormwater/deluge ponds. The FAA has determined that there is no alternative option that is a reasonable change of course from the primary proposal.",

            summary: "SpaceX conducted the fourth test flight of its Starship rocket, which successfully placed the Super Heavy booster into orbit around the Earth. The test was a major success, with both the booster and the spacecraft performing successful re-entry maneuvers and landing safely in the ocean. According to SpaceX, the test has brought significant progress towards a reusable future for space travel. 'The fourth flight of Starship has made great progress towards a fast, reusable future,' said SpaceX in a statement. 'Her performances will provide data to improve while we continue to develop Starship into a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.' The reusability of both parts of the powerful rocket is a key goal of SpaceX's Starship program, as it will reduce the cost of space travel for crewed and cargo missions to the Moon and beyond. SpaceX president Elon Musk revealed on Sunday that the next Starship test will use a catch mechanism on the launch tower at the SpaceX location in Boca Chica, Texas, to try to 'catch' the booster as it lands. Musk also revealed his plan to use the Super Heavy booster in 2020, which would save SpaceX the cost of building landing legs for the rocket. Removing this part of the construction would also reduce the weight of the booster, allowing it to carry less fuel and/or more payload. There is no date set for the fifth Starship test, but SpaceX's desire to increase the frequency of Starship flights suggests it could happen in the next two months.",

            summary: "SpaceX is preparing to launch its fourth test flight of the Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. The mission aims to achieve a smooth landing of the first stage (although still in the ocean, without recovery) and for the second stage (the actual spacecraft) to withstand the intense phase of atmospheric reentry. The company has made significant progress since the first integrated launch, with each test flight improving the rocket's performance. The fourth test will focus on replicating the successes of the third test and achieving a successful descent of the first stage and survival of the second stage during reentry, even if it does not make a soft landing in the Indian Ocean. This is the biggest challenge of the entire flight architecture, which aims to be the first launcher in the world to enable complete and rapid reusability. The company is expected to use the Starship to launch more powerful versions of its Starlink satellites, which provide global internet services with high-speed and low latency, and eventually to use it as a landing module for NASA's Artemis missions starting in 2026.",

The mission aims to evaluate the vehicle's ability to return to Earth safely and be reused. The Starship will attempt to land and splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy propellant and achieve a controlled re-entry. This capability is crucial for the future of SpaceX's reusable rockets and space travel, as it would significantly reduce costs and increase mission frequency. The previous test flight in March was successful, but the company lost contact with the vehicle during re-entry due to an unexpected engine failure. The upcoming test will feature hardware and software updates to improve performance and safety. The success of this flight would be a significant step towards achieving manned missions and cargo transport to destinations like the Moon and Mars.",

            summary: "SpaceX is preparing to launch its Starship spacecraft again, with a new test date set for June 5, pending FAA approval. This will be the fourth test flight, focusing on returning to Earth and reusing the rocket and its Super Heavy booster. The company announced that the new test will have significant improvements in hardware and software to ensure mission success. In the previous test, the Starship reached space but lost contact with the spacecraft during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The company attributed the failure to a smaller-than-expected landing thrust, possibly caused by a continuous filter blockage. Despite the setback, the test was important, as it allowed testing of the payload door in space and a demonstration of propellant transfer, crucial for future missions. The Starship development trajectory includes significant challenges. The first test flight in April last year ended in explosion four minutes after launch due to a Super Heavy booster leak. The incident caused environmental damage in the Texas region, including a forest fire, resulting in an investigation and 63 improvement requirements from the FAA. The second test had more success, with the Super Heavy booster's 33 engines functioning and the first stage separation. However, the rocket exploded shortly after, failing to return to Earth as planned. The third test in March was more promising, with the Starship completing a nearly complete orbit around the Earth, but exploding during re-entry, about 72 km from the surface. SpaceX continues to adjust and improve the Starship, aiming to eventually transport crews and cargo to the Moon and Mars. Elon Musk plans to use the rocket for NASA's Artemis III mission, which will send astronauts to the Moon in 2025. In the long term, Musk's vision is even more ambitious: using the Starship to transport people and cargo to Mars, a giant step in space exploration. Another company with bold goals is Blue Origin, led by Jeff Bezos, which has been competing with SpaceX.",

            summary: "SpaceX has successfully completed a wet dress rehearsal at its Starbase site in Texas, loading both stages of the Starship with liquid oxygen and liquid methane. This pre-launch test is crucial for verifying the rocket's preparation. SpaceX is developing Starship to support lunar and Martian colonization, among other ambitious goals. The company has already attracted several clients, including NASA, which has selected Starship as the first crewed lander for its Artemis program. The Starship is composed of two stainless steel stages, both designed to be fully reusable: a massive booster called Super Heavy and a 50-meter-high spacecraft called Starship or 'Ship'. When these two stages are stacked, Starship reaches a height of approximately 122 meters, making it the tallest rocket ever built. It is also the most powerful rocket in history, with approximately 16.7 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, almost double that of NASA's Space Launch System. The company is planning to launch the next flight within two weeks, pending regulatory approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). ",

            summary: "SpaceX is preparing for its fourth and fifth Starship launches, with the next one expected to take place in 3-5 weeks. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, has shared images of the Starship's assembly on Twitter, showing the massive rocket being placed on the Super Heavy booster. The Starship is designed to reach an altitude of 122 meters and can carry 100-150 metric tons of cargo, with the potential to extend to 250 tons. The company has been conducting tests of the rocket's engines in preparation for the launch, and is expected to simulate a landing on a ship in the Indian Ocean for the fourth launch. The goal is to demonstrate the reusability of the rocket and pave the way for future missions to the Moon and beyond.",

            summary: "NASA's exploration chief, Amit Kshatriya, outlined the next steps for SpaceX's Starship development, including a refueling demonstration in orbit next year. The demonstration will involve linking two Starships in orbit, a feat that will put the Moon within reach. SpaceX is under contract with NASA to supply two human-rated Starships for the first two astronaut landings on the Moon through the Artemis program. The Starship test program is gaining momentum, with the next test flight expected by the end of May. SpaceX plans to recover and rapidly reuse Starships and Super Heavy boosters, building on expertise from the partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket. The goal is to ramp up the Starship launch cadence to many daily flights from multiple launch sites, with a long-term goal of supporting a human settlement on Mars.",

            summary: "SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster has reached a record 20th flight, but did not land this time. The reusable booster was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, carrying a satellite for the European Commission's Galileo global navigation system. The mission was successful, but the booster was unable to return to Earth for a 20th landing due to its higher-than-usual orbit. The booster has been used for various missions, including GPS III-3, Turksat 5A, Transporter-2, Intelsat G-33/G-34, Transporter-6, Intuitive Machines IM-1, and over a dozen Starlink missions. SpaceX celebrated the achievement on social media, highlighting the booster's contributions to the company's Rideshare program, Starlink missions, and lunar lander. The company thanked its engineers for their work on the booster, which has delivered over 228 metric tons of payload to orbit. SpaceX is working to qualify its fleet of boosters and fairings for 40 missions each, with the goal of making reusable rockets a reality for its Starship program.",

The Falcon 9 rocket will carry 23 Starlink internet satellites into orbit. The launch window opens at 6:17 p.m. on Tuesday and closes at 10:15 p.m., with a backup window from 5:50-9:50 p.m. on Wednesday. Space Launch Delta 45 forecasts a 95% chance of good weather conditions for both days. This booster has flown eight times before, including one human spaceflight mission, and SpaceX will attempt to recover it downrange on the droneship Just Read the Instructions in the Atlantic Ocean. The company's first successful booster recovery was in December 2015, and it has not had a failed landing since February 2021. The current record holder for flights flew 11 days ago, making its 20th trip off the launch pad. SpaceX has launched 88 missions this year from Kennedy Space Center or Cape Canaveral, with United Launch Alliance launching the remaining two. SpaceX could reach 90 launches by the end of the year, with the pace expected to pick up for the remainder of the year. ULA also has several launches planned, including the May",

            summary: "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, presented an updated plan for the company's mission to transport humanity to Mars using the Starship spacecraft. The primary candidate for human settlement is Mars, and the Starship system, a massive spacecraft capable of vertical landing and reusability, will be used. The spacecraft achieved its designated space trajectory for the first time in its third trial, but technical failures occurred during re-entry and landing. Musk hopes the fourth experimental flight will be successful, and plans to implement a new landing technique for the launch vehicle and spacecraft. The company is also developing a new model of Raptor engines and a fuel transfer technology for future missions. The main innovation is the presentation of the future model of Starship, called Starship 3, which will be nearly 70 meters in height, capable of carrying over 200 tons of payload to Earth's orbit.",

            summary: "SpaceX launched the first of two rockets from the Space Coast over two days, carrying batches of the company's Starlink satellites. The second rocket is set to launch on Thursday evening. The Falcon 9 rocket on the Starlink 6-52 mission, carrying 23 Starlink satellites, is set to launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40. The launch is scheduled for a four-hour window from 6:40-10:40 p.m. on April 18, with a backup window on April 19 from 6:14-10:14 p.m. Space Launch Delta 45's weather squadron forecasts a 90% chance for good conditions for the launch. This is a southerly trajectory launch, which should be more visible down Florida's east coast. The first-stage booster is flying for the seventh time and will attempt a recovery landing downrange on the droneship A Shortfall of Gravitas. This is the 29th launch of the year, with all but two coming from SpaceX. SpaceX launched the 28th one day earlier with a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 23 of the internet satellites. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off at 5:26 p.m. from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39-A amid clear blue skies.",

            summary: "SpaceX is preparing for the fourth test flight of its Starship rocket in early May. The rocket has already completed three successful tests in the past year, with the latest one reaching orbit before disintegrating during its return to Earth. Despite the setback, the flight achieved several milestones, including the rocket's first hypersonic re-entry and the successful transfer of rocket propellant. SpaceX aims to increase the number of flights this year to accelerate commercial operations of the rocket. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk expressed optimism about the upcoming test flight, hoping that 'fate smiles upon us' and that the rocket will successfully navigate the high-heat re-entry phase and land safely in the Gulf of Mexico. The company plans to develop six more boosters and spacecraft this year to increase the launch rate of Starship. The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to send humans to Mars and establish a multi-planetary species, with a $2.89 billion contract with NASA to land humans on the Moon. The Starship was selected for the Artemis 3 mission, with plans to land humans on the Moon by 2026. Private individuals, including Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and US billionaire Jared Isaacman, have already booked seats on the Starship for future missions.",

            summary: "SpaceX is set to launch one of its Falcon 9 boosters for the 20th time on Friday, showcasing the success of its reusable rocket system. Booster 1062, which took its first flight in November 2020, will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, on Friday, April 12, on a mission to deploy 23 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit. A live webcast of the record-breaking flight will begin on X (formerly Twitter) at 9:17 p.m. ET, about five minutes before liftoff. The webcast will show the Falcon 9 rocket climbing into the sky for a record 20th time, stage separation, and the deployment of SpaceX's internet satellites. The first-stage booster will also land upright on the A Shortfall of Gravitas droneship in the Atlantic Ocean about eight minutes after launch, paving the way for the rocket's 21st flight. A backup opportunity for Friday's mission is available on Saturday should the targeted flight schedule require adjustment for any reason. Booster 1062 last flew on March 16 and holds the record for the fastest turnaround at 21 days following a flight on April 8, 2022. The rocket has previously launched GPS",

            summary: "SpaceX successfully conducted a landmark test of its new Starship launch system on Friday. The test, a static fire test, involved a 33-engine booster called Super Heavy and took place at the company's Starbase site in South Texas. CEO Elon Musk shared photos on social media of the test, which showed fire under the engine and plumes of smoke. The Starship is designed to transport people and cargo to the moon, Mars, and beyond. Despite three previous mission failures, the next mission could launch as early as May, according to SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell.

            summary: "Elon Musk announced that SpaceX's fourth Starship test flight is scheduled for May. A new FAA license is required, but the waiting time should be shorter than the previous test. Up to six tests are planned for 2024. The third attempt on March 14 ended with the explosion of both the Super Heavy/Booster 10 and Ship 28 stages of the Starship. However, important results were obtained. The FAA investigation has started, with results expected by the end of the month. It is likely that there will be few prescriptions for SpaceX, so the fourth test may be conducted at the beginning of May. At Starbase, Elon Musk provided an update on SpaceX's plans to send humans to Mars, the best destination to begin making life multiplanetary. Two static fire tests of Ship 29 were conducted at the end of March, and a static fire test of Booster 11 was conducted on April 6. The flight plan is not expected to change from the third test, with the first stage landing in the Atlantic Ocean and the second stage landing in the Indian Ocean. For the latter, an engine Raptor will be ignited in space. If Booster 11 lands in the Gulf of Mexico, the fifth test will attempt a return to the launch site, where the lower stage will be caught by Mechazilla, a tower crane. The same will happen for the upper stage, but only after two splashdowns. The recovery and subsequent",

            summary: "SpaceX has shared a stunning image of its Super Heavy booster on the launchpad ahead of the Starship's fourth test flight. The booster is at the Starbase facility in southern Texas. The company is waiting for a flight permit from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and hopes to launch in May. The Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft are collectively known as the Starship. The first two test flights ended seconds into flight, but the third one achieved many of its goals, including reaching orbit. The rocket will be used by NASA for crew and cargo missions to the moon as part of the Artemis missions and could be used for the first crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s. A modified version of the Starship spacecraft will be used in the Artemis III mission in 2026, which will see the first female and first person of color step onto the lunar surface. The Orion spacecraft, powered by NASA's new SLS rocket, will carry the astronauts to the lunar surface. The Orion has already been on a successful uncrewed test flight around the moon and is set to carry the first astronauts in the Artemis II test mission, currently scheduled for September 2025.",

            summary: "SpaceX successfully launched two rockets from the Space Coast on March 30, 2024. The first launch was the Eutelsat-36X mission, a communications satellite to geosynchronous transfer orbit, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39-A at 5:52 p.m. The first-stage booster flew for the 12th time and landed on the Just Read the Instructions droneship downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. The second launch was the Starlink 6-45 mission, carrying 23 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40 at 9:30 p.m. The first-stage booster flew for the 18th time and made another recovery landing on the droneship A Shortfall of Gravitas in the Atlantic. Meanwhile, United Launch Alliance (ULA) delayed the final launch of their Delta IV Heavy rocket due to an issue with a pump on the gaseous nitrogen pipeline from the shared ground systems supplying the Space Force station with the inert gas needed for safe launch operations. The launch was scheduled for Thursday, March 29, 2024, at Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 37. The Delta IV Heavy rocket is making its 16th flight and is the medium-lift version of the Delta IV",

            summary: "Starship, the rocket developed by SpaceX, is preparing for its fourth launch. After successfully completing its previous missions, the next test flight is scheduled for early May. The rocket, which is designed to transport humans to the moon for NASA's Artemis program, has encountered some delays and cost overruns. Despite this, SpaceX is pushing forward with its reusable rocket development. The company has been conducting key tests to prepare for the next test flight, where Starship must demonstrate its reusability. The massive rocket, which stands at 122 meters tall and 8 meters in diameter, can carry up to 100-150 metric tons of cargo and potentially extend that capacity to 250 tons. SpaceX aims to conduct six or more test flights with Starship this year, accelerating the pace of its launches. The company's goal is to make Starship a fully reusable vehicle as soon as possible. In its third launch, Starship successfully reached orbit, but during re-entry, the spacecraft broke apart, preventing the planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This will be the next challenge for the spacecraft in its next big meeting with the launch platform.",

            summary: "The Rocket Report: SpaceX plans to launch the next Starship test flight in early May. The Electron launch vehicle by Rocket Lab successfully launched from Wallops Island, Virginia. Rocket Lab's fourth launch from Wallops Island, Virginia, and the company's first there in nine months, took off early Thursday with a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office. The Electron rocket placed the NRO's payload into low-Earth orbit, and officials declared it a successful mission. The NRO did not disclose any details about the payload, but in a post-launch statement, the agency suggested the mission was conducting technology demonstrations of some kind. The National Reconnaissance Office has become a regular customer of Rocket Lab.

The Xodiac rocket, a small terrestrial vertical takeoff and vertical landing technology testbed, made its first night flight, Astrobotic says in a statement. The liquid-fueled Xodiac is designed for vertical hops and can host prototype sensors and other payloads, particularly instruments in development to assist in precision landings on other worlds. The military's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has signed an agreement with Firefly Aerospace to conduct a \"trade study\" on its capabilities to launch Firefly's Elytra space tugs and support missions beyond ge",

            summary: "SpaceX has successfully launched its powerful Starship for the fourth time, following a series of test flights. The team led by Elon Musk aims to launch the world's most powerful rocket into space for the fourth time in May. The time between launches has been affected by the need for engineers to analyze data from previous missions, which are overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). SpaceX cannot launch the Starship until it receives a launch permit from the FAA and is hoping for an early green light to meet its target date of May. Speaking at the Satellite 2024 conference in Washington, D.C., Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said engineers were still analyzing data from the latest flight and hoped to fly again in about six weeks. In comments reported by Space.com, Shotwell said the third test flight was 'incredibly successful... We got exactly where we wanted to go'. Unlike the first two test flights that ended abruptly when the vehicle exploded minutes after takeoff, the third test saw the Starship - including the Super Heavy booster of the first stage and the Starship spacecraft of the upper stage - successfully separate for the second time and complete the main part of the mission, including orbiting for the first time. However, things went wrong in the final stages when the Super Heavy exploded as it descended into the Gulf of Mexico, and the Starship disintegrated as it fell at high speed over the",

The rocket, the most powerful in the world, was launched with 10 million pounds of liquid methane and oxygen, a fuel that is often problematic due to its volatility and tendency to cause engine failures. The rocket successfully launched and landed, marking the first time a rocket has completed a full ascent. However, the mission was not without its challenges. The rocket's engines were not able to restart after the initial launch, and the booster stage crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. The second stage of the rocket, however, successfully completed a soft landing, marking a significant milestone in the development of reusable rockets. The rocket reached a speed of 16,156 miles per hour (26,000 kilometers per hour), surpassing the speed required for a stable orbit around Earth. The rocket's engines were active for approximately six minutes, making it the first spacecraft to complete a full ascent. Despite the successes, the mission was not without its setbacks. The rocket's engines were not able to restart after the initial launch, and the booster stage crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. The second stage of the",

            summary: "After two failed attempts that ended in explosions, SpaceX successfully launched its massive Starship rocket on its third test. The rocket, which stands at 120 meters tall, lifted off successfully from Boca Chica, Texas, at 7:25 am (Mexico City time). Starship, the world's largest and most powerful rocket, is designed for long-term use in trips to the Moon and Mars. NASA has chosen SpaceX's Starship as the vehicle that will transport its astronauts to the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission, which is scheduled to launch in September 2026. The rocket consists of two parts: the Super Heavy booster with 33 engines, and on top of this, the Starship spacecraft, which gives its name to the entire rocket. The separation of the two parts had been a problem in previous tests, but this time it was successful. Additionally, during the flight, they were able to open a cargo door, intended to demonstrate how it could be used for missions such as launching Starlink satellites into orbit. The spacecraft also managed to return to Earth under control after an hour of flight, but it was lost. Starship, the SpaceX rocket, was lost during its return to Earth. It was scheduled to land in the Indian Ocean, and although everything seemed fine, it was 'lost' when returning to the atmosphere, according to the company owned by Elon Musk. 'The spacecraft was lost', the live video",

            summary: "SpaceX is preparing to launch its next crew of astronauts to the International Space Station, despite the station experiencing an increased rate of air leaks. The flight includes three NASA astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut, and is scheduled to lift off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 11:16 p.m. on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Dragon spacecraft is expected to dock with the ISS at about 2:10 p.m. on Sunday. The presence of a Russian cosmonaut on the flight highlights the ongoing partnership between Russia and the US in space, despite growing tensions between the countries. The launch comes amid concerns about Russia's development of a nuclear weapon capable of targeting satellites, which could potentially damage the ISS and other satellites. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson expressed concern about the safety of astronauts and satellites, and the current leak is located in an area that has had leaks in the past. Boeing, another company hired by NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS, is also preparing for a test flight in late April with two NASA astronauts. SpaceX is also working on its next-generation fully reusable rocket booster and spacecraft, Starship, which NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon.",

            summary: "SpaceX is waiting for FAA approval to launch its Starship, the most powerful rocket ever flown, for its third test flight, hoping to get the green light next month after the November test flight incident. After the November test flight, SpaceX conducted an investigation under the supervision of the FAA, with the participation of NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. The FAA announced that SpaceX has identified and the FAA accepted the root causes and 17 corrective actions documented in SpaceX's accident report. Before the next launch, SpaceX must implement all corrective actions and receive a license modification from the FAA that meets all regulatory requirements for safety, environment, and others. In a post on its website, SpaceX shared some details about its analysis of the November flight, noting that it was the first Starship test to successfully separate stages after the failed test flight debut just minutes after liftoff in April. \\\"After stage separation, Super Heavy performed a boostback burn, instructing 13 of the 33 Raptor engines on the vehicle to propel the rocket towards its intended landing site\\\", SpaceX explained. \\\"During this burn, several engines began shutting down before one engine failed catastrophically, which quickly led to a rapid and unexpected structural failure (RUD) of the booster. The breakup occurred after more than three and a half minutes of flight at an altitude of approximately 90 kilometers above the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX stated that the most likely cause of the boost",

            summary: "SpaceX successfully launched its 11th mission from the Space Coast in 2024 on a clear blue sky Tuesday afternoon. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40 at 3:11 pm, carrying the Merah Putih 2 telecommunications satellite for Telkom Indonesia to a geosynchronous transfer orbit. This was the 17th launch of the first stage booster, and SpaceX made a recovery landing downrange on the Just Read the Instructions droneship in the Atlantic Ocean. This booster is one of the most flown of SpaceX's boosters, having previously launched the Crew-3 and Crew-4 human spaceflight missions among others. SpaceX has flown all but one of the launches from the Space Coast so far in 2023, with United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur having flown the other. The company has also flown six missions from California so far this year, making this flight its 16th across its three launch pads on both coasts. This year could see as many as 150 launches, according to Elon Musk. This doesn't include test launches from Texas of its in-development Starship and Super Heavy, which is gearing up for its third attempt at a successful suborbital launch as early as next month. 2024 Orlando Sentinel.

Public meetings will be held in March to present information on SpaceX's proposed actions and alternatives, answer questions, and collect comments. SpaceX's Starship rocket, the most powerful in history, is designed to transport humans, cargo, and payloads to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars. The rocket's lower booster stage is outfitted with 33 Raptor engines and can lift a 164-foot-tall spacecraft. The first test launch exploded shortly after liftoff last April, and a second test flight exploded in midair in November. SpaceX also proposes to expand its operations area at NASA's Kennedy Space Center by 100 acres.",

The upper-stage prototype, Ship 28, has been placed atop its Booster 10 first-stage partner. The company is preparing for a full launch rehearsal ahead of Flight 3, which is expected to occur about three weeks from now, provided the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration awards a launch license in time. The first two test flights of Starship, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built, occurred in April and November of last year. Although both missions ended in the explosive death of Starship, the vehicle notched some important milestones on Flight 2. SpaceX is developing Starship to take people and payloads to the moon and Mars, as well as conduct other operations closer to home. NASA has also signed up as a customer and has chosen Starship as the first crewed lander for its Artemis program of moon exploration. The Artemis 3 mission, scheduled for September 20",

The site is filled with Super Heavy vehicles, the first stage of the Starship, which are ready for the next three flights. Starship, which is the upper-stage spacecraft, is 165 feet tall and capable of launching up to 150 tons of payload to low Earth orbit. Although Starship has only launched twice for test flights, it has made significant progress and SpaceX aims to launch the next test mission this month, pending a launch license from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. NASA has also selected Starship as the first crewed moon lander for their Artemis program, with plans to land astronauts on the lunar surface by 2026.",

            summary: "SpaceX is preparing for a Starlink launch from Kennedy Space Center on Sunday night and a Cygnus cargo launch from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday. The Falcon 9 rocket will carry 23 satellites for the growing internet constellation. The first-stage booster will make its 18th flight and will make a recovery landing on the droneship A Shortfall of Gravitas. The Cygnus cargo spacecraft, which will be launched by SpaceX for the first time, will carry supplies to the International Space Station on the NG-20 mission. The switch to SpaceX for launch services came due to issues with Russian- and Ukrainian-made rocket engines and first-stage parts. The space station's Canadarm2 will grapple Cygnus and the spacecraft will attach to the Unity module's Earth-facing port for cargo unloading by the Expedition 70 crew.",

            summary: "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, explained the reasons behind the recent Starship rocket explosion during a recent update at Starbase in Texas. He stated that the vehicle would have continued its successful trajectory if it had been a normal, operational flight. The rocket was carrying no payload, which is why it exploded. SpaceX is developing the Starship to support human missions to Mars and other space research projects. The Starship consists of a first-stage booster called Super Heavy and an upper stage called Starship, which is 165 feet tall. SpaceX has conducted two tests of the Starship rocket, with the first ending in a controlled explosion due to issues with the separation of the two stages. Musk hopes for an operational capability soon, as SpaceX plans to send Starlink satellites aboard Starship by the end of the year. NASA also needs Starship to become operational for the Artemis moon exploration program, with Starship set to land space travelers on the lunar surface during the Artemis 3 mission in September 2",

            summary: "SpaceX's Starship and SuperHeavy booster rocket system failed its second flight test on November 18th, 2023. Elon Musk explained that the failure was due to a fuel venting issue near the end of the burn, which was avoidable. The Starship and SuperHeavy booster are powerful and versatile, capable of producing 16,700,000 pound force of thrust. The first launch test failed due to a faulty flight termination system. The second test almost reached orbit but failed due to the lack of a payload, causing a fire. The third test flight is scheduled for February 2024, and if successful, it will test de-orbit process, payload door operations, and propellant transfer from header tank to main tank. SpaceX aims to carry up to 100 people on interplanetary missions and play a crucial role in returning to the Moon.",
